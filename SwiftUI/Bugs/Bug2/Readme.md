To reproduce the bug:  
1. Build the project with XCode  
2. Run either on device or on simulator  
3. Tap "Screen1" to go to Screen1  
4. Tap "Screen3" to go to Screen3
5. Tap "Back"
6. Screen1 will briefly appear on the screen, but is then replaced with an empty view with only "Back" button. Screenshot: https://github.com/adensur/swift_learning/blob/main/SwiftUI/Bugs/Bug2/swift_bug2.png
